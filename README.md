# Webscraping
Data Collection is one of the biggest tasks in Today's world. To focus more on data collection and automation I have written scripts for data collection from a website [https://www.midsouthshooterssupply.com/dept/reloading/primers?itemsperpage=90](https://www.midsouthshooterssupply.com/dept/reloading/primers?itemsperpage=90)

Fields Scraped
- [x] Price in dollars
- [x] Title
- [x] Stock status i.e. in-stock or out-stock. If in-stock then the value would true and for out-stock value should be false.
- [x] Manufacturer i.e. Remington, Winchester, etc.
